        <p>I am a doctoral student currently working with quantum computing algorithms based on quantum walks. Enrolled on the Computational Modelling graduate program of the National Laboratory of Scientific Computing (LNCC) - Brazil. </p>
        <p>With a background in Math and Computer Science, I enjoy all kind of work that mixes analytical theory with applicable computing. I also work with mathematical modeling and numerical simulations on the context of bioinformatics, having published papers on the spatial and temporal dynamics of the <i>Aedes aegypti</i> mosquito.</p>

            <h5>Quantum-walk-based search algorithms with multiple marked vertices</h5>
            <p>The quantum walk is a powerful tool to develop quantum algorithms, which usually are based on searching for a vertex in a graph with multiple marked vertices, with Ambainis's quantum algorithm for solving the element distinctness problem being the most shining example. In this work, we address the problem of calculating analytical expressions of the time complexity of finding a marked vertex using quantum-walk-based search algorithms with multiple marked vertices on arbitrary graphs, extending previous analytical methods based on Szegedy's quantum walk, which can be applied only to bipartite graphs. Two examples based on the coined quantum walk on two-dimensional lattices and hypercubes show the details of our method.</p>

            <h5>Modeling and simulation of the spatial population dynamics of the Aedes aegypti mosquito with an insecticide application</h5>
            <p>The Aedes aegypti mosquito is the primary vector for several diseases. Its control requires a better understanding of the mosquitoes’ live cycle, including the spatial dynamics. Several models address this issue. However, they rely on many hard to measure parameters. This work presents a model describing the spatial population dynamics of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes using partial differential equations (PDEs) relying on a few parameters.</p>

            <h5>Impact of temperature variation on spatial population dynamics of Aedes aegypti</h5>
            <p>This work aims to study a model of partial differential equations (PDE) for the population dynamics of the Aedes aegypti mosquito. We propose a numerical resolution using finite volumes. We evaluated the influence of temperature in modeling the parameters and the results for simulations at three different temperatures. The obtained results encourage a discussion about the importance of prevention during the rainy season and compare the cases of dengue during the first thirty epidemiological weeks of two thousand and nineteen.</p>
